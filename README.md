# Gemor kernel

## Introduction

**Welcome to Germor kernel repository!**

This repository is intended to be my sandbox for diving into kernel development along
with Rust programming language.

Many tutorials that I've watched, were compromising complex kernel development
with simplicity for the sake of introduction.
This will not take place here. I want to create a system with up-to-date
standards which include UEFI and 64-bit processors.
